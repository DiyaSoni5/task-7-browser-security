## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Extensions with broad permissions (e.g., **"Read and change all your data on all websites"**) can be very dangerous.
- Always **verify the publisher and reviews** before installing any extension.
- Regularly auditing your browser helps prevent data leaks and phishing risks.
- Even legit-looking extensions can be malicious — **stay cautious**!

## 📌 Interview-Ready Q&A

### 🔐 How can browser extensions be dangerous?
They can track your browsing, steal cookies, read passwords, inject ads, or even hijack sessions.

### 🚩 What permissions are considered suspicious?
- Full access to all websites
- Clipboard reading
- Tab management
- History manipulation

### 🔒 How to install extensions safely?
